# IT Support Labs (Portfolio)

This repository contains my hands-on IT Support labs written in a ticket-style format.

## Labs
- [Lab 00 — Lab Environment Setup (VMware + Ubuntu)](00-setup/README.md)

## What this shows
- I can build a safe lab environment
- I can troubleshoot issues and document fixes clearly
- I can use Git/GitHub to track work and publish a portfolio
